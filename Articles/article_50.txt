An individual suspected of attempting to kill his wife by causing a viper to sting her and his mistress who aided and abetted the alleged crime were produced before Gampaha Chief Magistrate D.A. Ruwan Pathirana by the Gampaha Police and remanded till today (10).
Another suspect, suspected of aiding and abetting the crime, had been arrested and remanded on July 1. The suspects were residents of Gampaha.
Police had arrested the two suspects during investigations into a complaint lodged by the wife of the main suspect.
Wildlife Conservation Officials had examined the serpent and confirmed that it was a viper, which is considered poisonous. Police told court that the main suspect and his mistress had conspired to kill the complainant and sought the help of the young man, arrested earlier, to perpetrate the crime. (Tony Karunanayake)
