Reuters – A man who pushed a 91-year-old passenger onto the tracks at a busy London Underground train station was sentenced to life imprisonment on Monday (June 24), after earlier being found guilty of two counts of attempted murder.
Paul Crossley, underwent months of psychiatric assessment before he was sentenced by a judge to a hospital order until he is deemed fit for prison, where he will spend a minimum of 12 years, the British Transport Police said.
Security camera footage showed Crossley attempted to push a 23-year-old man onto the tracks, unsuccessfully, at Tottenham Court Road station in central London on April 27 last year.
Crossley then traveled a couple of stops to Marble Arch station. There, he shoved an elderly man who suffered multiple pelvic fractures and a severe cut as he plunged head-first onto the tracks.
Detective Inspector Darren Gough, the senior investigating officer, said he was pleased to see Crossley sentenced.
