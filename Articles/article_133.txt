REUTERS: Thailand’s government made final preparations for hosting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit due to take place at the weekend in Bangkok.
Security was tightened around the city, and officials have said some 10,000 security personnel were set to be deployed, mindful of the incident 10 years ago when a summit of Asian leaders had to be cancelled after anti-government protesters stormed into the venue.
The summit will take place on the upcoming Saturday (June 22) and Sunday (June 23) in downtown Bangkok, bringing together leaders from 10 countries –Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Myanmar, Brunei and Singapore.
