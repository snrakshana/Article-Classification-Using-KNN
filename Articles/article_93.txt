An Indian trader has been found dead at his lodging in Atulugama yesterday (Jul 24), police said.
Kumaresan Chandrasekaran, 38, had been engaging in garment trading for about four years by importing products from India and selling them to shops in Colombo and Bandarawela.
Preliminary investigations by the Bandaragama Police have revealed that the garments had been sold on credit to these shops.
An acquaintance of the Indian national, who is a three-wheel driver, had found the trader lying motionless when he had visited him last morning. The driver is also believed to have engaged in business activities with his counterpart.
Police said that the Bandaragama Hospital had confirmed the trader's death after he had been taken to the hospital.
Further investigations continue.
