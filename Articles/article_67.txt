The British government has initiated an investigation after the Sri Lankan government decided to redirect the containers of waste disposal
imported to the country from Great Britain.
Customs ocials said that the imported consignment was hospital waste.
The British Solid Waste Recycling Association has stated that such imports and exports should be condemned.
