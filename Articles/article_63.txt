The Supreme Court ordered to suspend the hearing of the Attorney General’s petition against former defence secretary Gotabhaya
Rajapaksa and several others until October 1 .
The order was issued when a special appeal led by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was taken before Justices Buwaneka Aluvihare, Gamini
Amarasekera and S Thurairajah today.
Earlier, Attorney General had sued 7 respondents including Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for misappropriating 33.9 million rupees in the
construction of Medamulana DA Rajapaksa museum.
The case was scheduled to be taken before the Permanent High Court at bar tomorrow.
At the same time, the  Permanent High court at bar rejected the preliminary objections led by Gotabaya Rajapaksa citing that that court
has no jurisdiction to hear his case.
Later, the former defence secretary challenged the decision at the Court of Appeal but it also dismissed the case even without considering
citing that it has no such jurisdiction to do so.
Thereafter, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa challenged the dismissal of his petition by the Appeal court before the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court then took note of the submission made by Gotabhaya’s lawyer President Counsel Romesh de Silva and granted leave to
proceed the petition thereby xing the hearing on October 1 .
Later, the Supreme Court issued an order suspending the hearing of the case before the Permanent High Court at bar.
