The revision petition filed by the Attorney General (AG) against a court ruling to release on bail two top state officials over the April 21 terrorist attacks was fixed for support on August 1.
AG Dappula de Livera, had challenged Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne’s decision to release Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara and former defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando on bail.
Jayasundara, and Fernando had been arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department, upon the instructions of the AG, over charges of failure to prevent the terrorist bombings despite having prior intelligence warnings on the incident.
The petition is being heard before High Court judge Vikum Kaluarachchi.
