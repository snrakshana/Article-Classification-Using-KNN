The Sri Lanka Association of Administrative and Professional Secretaries (SLAAPS) has come forward to maintain Ward 11 — Half Way Home — at the National Institute of Mental Health to mark the Founders Day. To help their cause, the United Arab Emirates embassy donated six fans to the Ward recently and more donations are expected next month. United Arab Emirates Ambassador Ahmed Ali Ibrahim Al Mualla is seen here handing over donation to SLAAPS President Ruveena Cader. Also present were SLAAPS member Shireen Rajee, Ambassador’s Secretary Gayanee de Alwis and SLAAPS Vice President Azra Reyaldeen.
