Private bus drivers in Elpitiya have ended their strike which was launched this morning, after police and officials from the local transport authority intervened to resolve their issues.
Drivers had launched a strike citing three demands relating to unregistered bus owners, supervision of buses, and fines for traffic related offences.
They had claimed that unregistered bus owners were gaining undue advantage by engaging in passenger service operations in the area.
Drivers had also demanded a reduction in fines for traffic related offences, while also urging that the Southern Provincial Road Passenger Transport Authority must stop monitoring buses.
An official at the Authority conceded that the demand regarding unregistered bus owners was reasonable. However, he noted that the other two demands could not be justified.
He explained that the Authority had been monitoring buses using CCTV cameras to determine whether they were travelling as per the schedule provided to them.
However, drivers had protested against this move urging to remove the surveillance cameras in the area.
Private buses in Elpitiya on strike
Private bus drivers operating from Elpitiya are engaged in a strike action over a transport service issue since today (Jul 23) morning.
Accordingly, buses operating from Elpitiya to Galle, Ambalangoda, Pelawatte, and Mapagalama, will not be in operation today.
Drivers allege that they have been faced with losses since unregistered buses have been used to transport passengers in Galle.
They claim that talks with transport authorities over this matter have proven to be futile.
