REUTERS: Chinese President Xi Jinping met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in Osaka, Japan, on Friday. Xi is in Japan for a summit of the Group of 20 (G20) major economies slated for Friday and Saturday. Xi said China always supports multilateralism and the positive role of the UN in international affairs and will continue to support the UN and the Secretary-General’s work with practical actions.
In a world of increasing complication and turbulence, the Gulf region is particularly sensitive and is standing at a crossroads of war and peace, Xi said. The president added that China always stands on the side of peace and opposes wars, calling on all sides involved to remain calm and restrained; enhance dialogue and safeguard regional peace and stability.
Xi pointed out that the G20 summit in Osaka should fully consider the needs of global development and send a correct signal to the outside world. China appreciates Secretary-General’s effort in promoting international cooperation to cope with climate change and would like to contribute to a positive result of the Climate Action Summit. For his part, Guterres appreciated China’s long-term support to the UN and spoke highly of China’s important contribution to a political settlement of the Korean Peninsula issue, dealing with climate change and sustainable development.
China’s proposal of Belt and Road Initiative is essential to global development, especially to Africa’s development, Guterres said. The UN hopes China can display more leadership in international affairs and the UN will provide full support and cooperation. The UN would like to work with China to better play the role of global governance and make multilateralism-abiding the international mainstream.
