A report has been called from the Government Analyst to ascertain whether any human remains or chemical substances mixed with the
controversial waste material brought from the United Kingdom.
A part of the imported waste is currently piled up in a yard belonging to a private company in the Katunayake Free Trade Zone.
Central Environmental Authority Director-General Hemantha Jayasinghe said his preliminary investigation revealed that these British waste
are piled up there without obtaining an Environmental Protection Permit.
At the same time, transporting hazardous waste from one country to another has been banned by Basel Convention.
Both Britain and Sri Lanka have signed into this convention, therefore, Environmental Authority Director-General Jayasinghe said that the
matter has been complained to the Basel Headquarters in Switzerland.
