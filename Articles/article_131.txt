REUTERS: Indian security forces killed four militants in a gunfight on Sunday (June 23) that ensued after they surrounded the holed up insurgents in Kashmir’s Shopian district.
Local police said that they launched an operation in Shopian on Saturday (June 22) evening, in which the police, Army, and paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) launched the operation based on specific inputs.
Director General of Police Dilbagh Singh said that all four of the slain militants belonged to either Shopian or Pulwama. He added that a large number of arms and ammunition and other incriminating material was recovered from their possession.
Unrest has simmered in Kashmir, home to a separatist movement, for decades. An insurgency that erupted in 1989 against India has eased in recent years, but most Kashmiris yearn for independence and some support the few hundred militants still fighting.
