Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse a group of protesters near the Lotus Roundabout in Colombo.
The protest had been organized by unemployed graduates over several demands.
The Lotus Road had been temporarily closed owing to the protest with riot police personnel and barricades placed near the roundabout blocking the path of protesters.
However, police resorted to using water cannons and tear gas as the protesters attempted to march past the blockade.
Heavy traffic congestion had been reported in the area and connected roads as a result of the agitation.
