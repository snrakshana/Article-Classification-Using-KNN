British media reported today that its government has launched an investigation after Sri Lankan authorities said they would send back more
than a hundred shipping containers because they appeared to contain human remains disguised as recyclable material.
The Telegraph reported that the Ocials of the port of Colombo made the grisly discovery while investigating a strong smell emanating
from 111 containers which have been arriving at the docks over the past two years.
Meanwhile, a protest was staged in front of the British High Commission today, demanding Britain to take back the hazardous hospital
waste in question.
A petition in this regard was handed over to the high commission by the president of the Surakimu Sri Lanka organization, Pahiyangala
Ananda Sagara Thera.
Meanwhile, a group including NFF MP Jayantha Samaraweera visited the Katunayake investment promotion zone where the said hazardous
hospital waste has been laying.
Meanwhile, issues related to this hazardous waste, were a topic of discussion in parliament today.
Meanwhile, a member of the sectoral supervision steering committee on industries, MP Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said that the BOI
ocials admitted the imported containers are loaded with waste materials.
Speaking further on the matter in parliament, MP Yapa said that the particular waste importer has become bankrupt by now.
