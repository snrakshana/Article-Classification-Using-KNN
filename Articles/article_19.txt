The bodies of 10-month-old twin girls, who have been murdered, have been discovered at a house in Nintavur, Sammanthurai.
Police said that the two infants were found hacked to death inside the bathroom of the house this morning (29).
The mother of the infant twins, who is suspected of committing the horrific act, has been admitted to hospital and is receiving treatment under police custody.
The mother is suspected to be suffering from a mental illness.
Ada Derana reporter said that a knife believed to have been used to murder the infants was also found near the bodies at the house.
