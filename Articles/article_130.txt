REUTERS: Ethiopia’s army Chief of Staff Seare Mekonnen and another retired general were shot dead, an Ethiopian state broadcaster said on Sunday (June 23), after a general tried to seize control of Amhara in an attempted coup. Seare and General Gezai Abera were shot dead in the former’s home in Addis Ababa by his bodyguard.
In a separate but related attack, Amhara state president Ambachew Mekonnen and his advisor were shot dead and the state’s attorney general was wounded in Amhara’s capital of Bahir Dar on Saturday (June 22) evening, according to a statement from the office of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.
Abiy’s office named Amhara state security head General Asamnew Tsige as responsible for the foiled coup, without giving details of his whereabouts. Asamnew was released from prison last year, having been given an amnesty for a similar coup attempt, according to media reports.
