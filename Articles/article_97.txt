Elephant House Beverages recently re-launched fresh milk adding more variety to the wide product portfolio thus catering to the tastes of its many consumers. 
Fresh milk which had been available in the markets since the early 90s in glass bottles is now available in 1 litre Tetra packs, the company announced on Thursday.  
The Elephant House brand has strong brand recognition as a household staple dating back to the 1950s. The relaunch of this well-beloved household milk product brings the goodness and taste of the locally sourced fresh milk to the new generations. 
Placed among the top two players with a leading market share in the category, Elephant House also launched flavoured milk in Vanilla, Strawberry and Chocolate flavours in 190 ml tetra packs in April 2018. 
The products are manufactured using pure locally sourced fresh milk from farms in Kurunegala and Dambulla. The milk products are available primarily in the Western and Central provinces and will be soon made available in other provinces. 
“We always strive to give our consumers the best produce and are fully conscious of the importance of building a healthy community. Fresh milk is known for its health benefits throughout the generations and is a must have in every home. Our consumers are becoming more aware of the healthy benefits and pay more attention to what they eat and drink,” said President of Consumer Foods, Daminda Gamlath of John Keells PLC. 
The relaunches of milk and water during the last year has placed Elephant House beverages in all categories within the Non-Alcoholic Ready to Drink Category thus completing the brand’s portfolio in the beverages category. This latest addition is currently available at all Keells outlets and will be soon expanded to modern and general trade outlets.
