colombo (news 1st): iran’s president has responded with defiance to the latest sanctions imposed by the us, saying they show that the us is lying about wanting dialogue.
hassan rouhani said donald trump’s policy was one of desperation, calling the white house “mentally retarded”. the sanctions against iran’s supreme leader would be useless, while those targeting its foreign minister closed off diplomacy, rouhani warned. trump said he was responding to recent “aggressive behaviour” by iran.
the us has also accused iran of being behind two sets of explosions that have damaged six oil tankers in the region, through which a fifth of the world’s oil passes each day. iran has rejected the allegation. last month, the president stepped up the pressure by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying iranian oil, saying he wanted to deny iran’s government its principal source of revenue.
in response, rouhani announced that iran was scaling back some of its commitments under the nuclear deal. officials expect its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to breach a 300kg limit. enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel and potent nuclear weapons. u.s. national security adviser john bolton, speaking after the united states increased sanctions against iranian officials, said washington was still willing to talk to iran.
