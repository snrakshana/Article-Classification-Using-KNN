the director of the criminal investigation department (cid) senior superintendent of police (ssp) shani abeysekera has lodged a complaint with the police against attorney at law manoj gamage.
the complaint has been lodged over a case of the lawyer threatening the ssp at a media conference, stated the police media spokesperson.
a press conference of the national alliance for lawyers associations was held on 27th july where dr. mohamed shafi and the actions of the department of the attorney general were strongly criticized.
speaking at the media conference, gamage stated that the government isn’t taking proper action against the doctor owing to his immense wealth.
according to the lawyer, dr. shafi has assets worth 400-900 million and is able to buy the whole ‘yahapalana’ government if he wanted.
gamage calls on ssp shani abeysekera to work in accordance with the law, keeping in mind that power does not remain forever.
he further said that he warns abeysekera might be able to experience the results of tampering with the law in prison.
