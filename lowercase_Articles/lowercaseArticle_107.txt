surrey distinguished professor s. ravi p. silva will talk on,  “clean, green and free: solar electricity for 2035” in the monthly lecture of the national trust – sri lanka at the hnb auditorium, 22nd  floor, hnb towers, 479 t.b. jayah mawatha, colombo 10  on thursday, july 25 at 6.30 p.m.
energy generation worldwide is going through major change. solar energy has been expanding at over 40% per annum for over a decade. yet, solar electricity at present accounts for barely 2% of the entire energy provision.
the dominance of fossil fuel-based energy generation is being challenged, predominantly by cheap crystalline silicon solar cells coming to the market. would the story end here? what happens with the steady progress envisaged in the organic-inorganic plastic electronic technologies era?
prof. silva will discuss novel technologies being progressed using 4g (4th generation) solar cells that include perovskites and show how these will all develop into a very interesting decade of technology development in flexible organic electronics as part of the energy mix. the routes for higher efficiency organic cells, while maintaining the low-cost base will be discussed.
professor ravi silva is surrey distinguished professor and the director of the advanced technology institute (ati) and head of the nano-electronics centre (nec) at the university of surrey. he was advisor to the ministry of science and technology in sri lanka in 2008 to set up the sri lanka institute of nanotechnology and the nano-science park nanco (private) ltd. he remains an advisor to these activities and is on the board of directors.
those who wish to attend the lecture, are requested to contact the trust office on 2682730 / 0778081214 at the post graduate institute of archaeology, 407, bauddhaloka mawatha, colombo 7, by tuesday, july 23 and provide personal details and vehicle no. if applicable, due to security concerns.
