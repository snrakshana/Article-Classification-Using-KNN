reuters – a new zealand man was jailed for 21 months on tuesday (june 18) on charges of distributing videos of the christchurch shootings.
a lone gunman killed 51 people at two mosques in christchurch on march 15 while live-streaming the massacre on facebook.
philip arps, 44, had pleaded guilty to two charges of distributing objectionable material after sharing copies of the live-streamed video to about 30 people soon after the massacre, radio new zealand reported.
he had another version of the mass shooting video that was modified to add cross-hairs and a body count to the video, rnz said.
a self-described white supremacist, arps was charged with “offensive behavior” and fined nz$800 ($543) in 2016 after he delivered a bloodied pig’s head to al noor mosque, one of the mosques that were targeted in the mass shooting.
