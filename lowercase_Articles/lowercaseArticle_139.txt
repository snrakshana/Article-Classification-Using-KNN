    aljazeera – iran’s elite revolutionary guards corps (irgc) have shot down a us “spy” drone in the southern province of hormozgan, the guard’s news website, sepah news, claimed on thursday.
“it was shot down when it entered iran’s airspace near the kouhmobarak district in the south,” the report added.
iran’s state-run irna news agency citing the irgc, identified the drone as an rq-4 global hawk.
captain bill urban, a us central command spokesman, declined to comment when asked if an american drone was shot down.
however, he told the associated press: “there was no drone over iranian territory.”
the reported shootdown comes amid heightened tensions between iran and the us since last year, when president donald trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between tehran and major powers and reimposed sanctions on the country.
