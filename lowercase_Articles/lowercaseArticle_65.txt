six suspicious persons have been arrested by the police in the wanathavilluwa lakto estate in puttalam.
the estate is suspected to have been used to store the explosives used in the easter sunday attacks.
police said that two of the six suspects arrested have been previously arrested from the estate before the attacks and were released on
bail.
the suspects have told the police that they had come to water the coconut trees in the estate and to take equipment from the poultry farm.
however the court has prohibited entry to the estate other than the owner after the explosives were found.
the six suspects have entered the estate in the morning disregarding the ban.
subsequently they were arrested on a tip off by the residents of the area and the wanathavilluwa polie are conducting further investigation.
the criminal investigations department (cid) uncovered a large quantity of raw materials used to make explosives, including detonators
before the easter sunday attacks on the 16th of january last year.
