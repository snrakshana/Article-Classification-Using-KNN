reuters – more than a thousand protesters marched to the u.s. consulate and european union office in hong kong on wednesday (june 26) to call on nations in the g20 to raise the plight of hong kong with china and to support the full scrapping of a controversial extradition bill.
hong kong’s beijing-appointed leader carrie lam suspended the bill, that would allow citizens and foreigners to be sent to mainland china for trial, after millions of hong kong people protested, leading to some violent clashes with the police, over the past three weeks.
holding placards reading “president trump, liberate hong kong” and chanting “free hong kong”, the demonstrators, some wearing shirts reading “liberate hong kong” marched to a succession of consulates represented at the group of 20 major economies summit in japan’s osaka this weekend.
china said on monday (june 24) the bill was an internal matter and will not allow it to be discussed at the g20.
