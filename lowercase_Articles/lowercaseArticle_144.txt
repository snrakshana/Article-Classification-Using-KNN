reuters – hong kong chief executive carrie lam turned tearful when speaking about mass protests against an extradition bill on wednesday (june 12).
tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets to fight the bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland china for trial, with tempers flaring.
lam admitted the bill was controversial, but said she had “sacrificed” a lot for the city, during an interview with broadcaster tvb.
she has vowed to press ahead with the legislation amid calls for her to step down.
the government said the debate on the bill that was due to take place in the legislative council on wednesday would be delayed until further notice.
