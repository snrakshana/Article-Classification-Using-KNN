reuters –  eight people were killed on monday (june 17) after a dinghy carrying migrants sank off turkey’s western coast, the state-run anadolu news agency said, adding that 31 others had been rescued.
search and rescue operations were launched by the coast guard to reach the passengers of the boat, which sunk off the coast of the bodrum district in the mugla province.
the operations carried out with two boats, a diving team and a helicopter from the coast guard, had found the bodies of eight people from the boat, which was carrying 40 migrants in total.
