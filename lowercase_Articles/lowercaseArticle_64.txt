a new salary structure for postal workers have been taken up for discussion at the cabinet meeting held yesterday.
since the special commission appointed to review public sector salaries and a number of other services and state institutions have
submitted their recommendations, it was decided that it would not be appropriate to implement the recommendations only to the postal
department.  
however, the convener of the joint postal trade union front, chinthaka bandara said that they are expecting to pay attention to this matter at
a special committee meeting to be held tomorrow.
he also stated that if the government does not address issues of postal workers, they would be compelled to initiate a continuous strike in
the coming week.
